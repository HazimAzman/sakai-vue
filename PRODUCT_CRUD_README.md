# Product CRUD Admin Panel

This document explains the new CRUD functionality for managing products in the admin panel.

## Features

### 1. Database Structure
The products table has been updated with the following fields:
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Product name (e.g., "Witeg", "IKA")
- `description` - Product description
- `image_path` - Path to product image (e.g., "/images/product/witeg-150.png")
- `category` - Product category (e.g., "Laboratory Instrument")
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

### 2. API Endpoints
The following REST API endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/products` - List all products
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get specific product
- `POST /api/products/create` - Create new product
- `PUT /api/products/{id}/update` - Update existing product
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}/delete` - Delete product

### 3. Admin Interface
Access the admin panel at `/admin` and navigate to the "Products" tab to:
- View all products in a data table
- Add new products
- Edit existing products
- Delete products
- Upload and manage product images

### 4. Frontend Integration
The ProductWidget component continues to display hardcoded products as before. The admin panel provides CRUD functionality for managing products in the database separately.

## Setup Instructions
