## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
Run the automated setup script:
```powershell
# PowerShell (recommended)
.\setup-all-widgets.ps1

# Or individual setup
.\setup-products.ps1
```

### Manual Setup

#### 1. Database Migrations
Run all migrations to create the required tables:
```bash
cd backend/backend-api
php yii migrate
```

#### 2. Seed All Data
Populate the database with all original widget data:
```bash
cd backend/backend-api
php yii seed-products
php yii seed-services
php yii seed-about
php yii seed-downloads
php yii seed-clients
php yii seed-contacts
```

#### 3. Start Backend Server
Make sure your backend server is running:
```bash
cd backend/backend-api
php yii serve
```

#### 4. Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
